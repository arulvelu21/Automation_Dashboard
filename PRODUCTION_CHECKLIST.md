# Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Production build succeeds
- [x] Database schema support implemented
- [x] Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- [x] Environment configuration documented
- [x] SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- [x] Input validation with Zod schemas

## 🟡 Recommended Before Production

### 1. ✅ Structured Logging & Monitoring (IMPLEMENTED)
```bash
# ✅ Already installed and configured
# - Pino for structured logging
# - Rotating file streams with daily rotation
# - Log compression (gzip)
# - 30-day retention policy
# - Separate loggers for: database, API, security, performance
```

**Features implemented:**
- 📁 **Log Rotation:** Daily rotation with gzip compression
- 🗄️ **Database Logging:** Query performance and connection monitoring  
- 🌐 **API Logging:** Request/response tracking with timing
- 🔒 **Security Logging:** Authentication and access monitoring
- ⚡ **Performance Logging:** Slow query and request detection
- 📊 **Log Management:** Scripts for analysis and cleanup

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run logs:status   # View log files and disk usage
npm run logs:tail     # Follow current logs
npm run logs:analyze  # Generate performance report
npm run logs:clean    # Clean old logs (keeps 7 days)
```

### 2. Security Headers
Add to `next.config.mjs`:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  headers: async () => [
    {
      source: '/(.*)',
      headers: [
        { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
        { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
        { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'origin-when-cross-origin' },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### 3. Database Connection Limits
```bash
# In production .env
PGHOST=your-prod-host
PGUSER=your-prod-user  
PGPASSWORD=your-secure-password
PGDATABASE=resolve_automation
PGSCHEMA=resolve_automation
PGSSL=require
# Add connection pool limits
PGMAXCONNECTIONS=10
PGIDLE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Consider adding:
- Database query performance monitoring
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Health check endpoint monitoring

### 5. Deployment
```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
